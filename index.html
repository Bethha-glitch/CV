  <p>I was introduced to tech within the past year and after researching and
    doing some basic coding lessons, I found myself having fun and enjoying the
    coding process even through the fustrating lows. I found the possibility of
    being able to develop a webpage that could not only assist myself with my day
    to day needs but others as well. My goal as a developer is to help create/develop
    a system or webpage that assists those that have disabilities as i believe
    that we as a society still have a long way to go and do when it comes to making
    sure that everybody is able to use the items that are being created. I don't
    know how that looks right now but I hope I am able to learn and discover
    through working in your company.

  <!--<p> Elizabeth is a 22 year old Developer. She gained interest
    in tech during the corona virus pandemic after she found it hard
    to mentain having a personal life and working long hours to make ends
    meet. Although she liked the job is was doing, she was losing her youth
    to work. Hearing multiple people talk about the tech industry and how they
    are looking for people from different backgrounds and cultures as well as it being
    one of the most flexible jobs out there, she didn't take long before she
    researched about the industry and what it is that she could bring to the table
    to her future employers</p>-->

  <h3><strong>Hobbies And Interests</strong></h3>
  <br />

  <ol>
    <li>
      Reading. Some would think otherwise considering how little
      I've read the past couple of years but I do love to read and
      I have since i was little, i still remember how i discovered
      my love for reading.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Sewing. Textiles is something I've done since i was in school
      and I try to still make time for it although it can be very difficult
      at times.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Unlike my two hobbies listed earlier, although i am not very good
      at it, drawing is definitely something that i would like to carry on
      doing until i get to a skill level i'm happy with.
